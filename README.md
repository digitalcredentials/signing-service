## Summary

Use this express server to sign [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). 

NEW: as of version 1.0.0 the signing-service works with both version 1 and version 2 Verifiable Credentials.
NEWER: as of version 1.1.0, a new 'suite' query parameter instructs the signing-service to attach proofs with type of either Ed25519SignatureSuite or DataIntegrity (with an Eddsa cryptosuite) - or both!

Implements four http endpoints:

 * POST /instance/:instanceId/credentials/sign?suite=eddsa2022|ed25519 (default is ed25519)

Which signs and returns a [Verifiable Credential](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) that has been posted to it.

 * GET /did-key-generator

Which is a convenience method for generating a new signing key, encoded as a [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and specifically using the [did:key method](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/). Read about how to use it in the [did:key generator section](#didkey-generator).

* POST /did-web-generator

Which is a convenience method for generating a new signing key, encoded as a [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), specifically using the [did:web method](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/). Read about how to use it in the [did:web generator section](#didweb-generator).

* GET /healthz

Which is an endpoint typically meant to be called by the Docker [HEALTHCHECK](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#healthcheck) option for a specific service. Read more below in the [Health Check](#health-check) section.

The signing endpoint is meant to be called as a RESTful service from any software wanting to sign a credential, and in particular is so used by the [DCC issuer-coordinator](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/issuer-coordinator) and the  [DCC workflow-coordinator](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/worfklow-coordinator) from within a Docker Compose network.

This service supports multiple signing keys ([DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)), identified by the `:instanceId` in the signing endpoint's path. An `instance` is sometimes also called a `tenant`.

You may also want to take a look at the [DCC issuer-coordinator](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/issuer-coordinator), as it provides bearer token security over tenant endpoints, and combines both signing and status revocation as a single service. It also describes a model for composing DCC services within a Docker Compose network.

The [DCC workflow-coordinator](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/workflow-coordinator) goes a step further and adds support for directly adding credentials to a wallet like the [Learner Credential Wallet](lcw.app).

Or if you are ready to dive right in and issue a whole batch of credentials, with csv upload, email notification for recipients, and wallet collection then check out the [DCC Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/admin-dashboard).

## Quick Start

You can try this signing-service in about three minutes:

1. Install Docker, which is made very easy with the [Docker installers for Windows, Mac, and Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

2. From a terminal prompt, run:

```
docker run -dp 4006:4006 digitalcredentials/signing-service:1.1.0
```

You can now issue test credentials as explained in the [Sign a Credential](#sign-a-credential) section.

IMPORTANT: this quick start version uses a test signing key that is not registered to an actual issuer, so when verifying credentials issued with the test key they will be marked as test credentials. To use this in production you'll have to generate your own signing key, and register it publicly. To do so, read on...

## Configuration

### Tenants

You might want to allow more than one signing key ([DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)) to be used with the issuer. For example, you might want to sign university/college degree diplomas with a key ([DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)) that is only used by the registrar, but then also allow certificates for individual courses to be signed by by different keys ([DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)) that are owned by the faculty or department that teaches the course.

We're calling these differents signing authorities 'tenants' (or 'instances').  You can set up as many tenants as you like by including a `TENANT_SEED_{TENANT_NAME}={seed}` environment variable for every 'tenant'. (NOTE: if you are using a did:web key, you must additinally specify `TENANT_DIDMETHOD_{TENANT_NAME}=web` and `TENANT_DID_URL_{TENANT_NAME}={the url for your did:web}`) for each did:web tenant. Read more in the [did:web generator section](#didweb-generator).

NOTE: the `seed` is explained below in the [Signing key section](#signing-key).

So, if you wanted to set up two tenants, one for degrees and one for completion of the Econ101 course then you could create the tenants by setting the following in the .env file:

```
TENANT_SEED_DEGREES=z1AoLPRWHSKasPH1unbY1A6ZFF2Pdzzp7D2CkpK6YYYdKTN
TENANT_SEED_ECON101=Z1genK82erz1AoLPRWHSKZFF2Pdzzp7D2CkpK6YYYdKTNat
```

The tenant names can then be specified in the issuing invocation like so:

```
http://myhost.org/instance/degrees/credentials/issue
http://myhost.org/instance/econ101/credentials/issue
```

Note that these are all unsecured calls. You can choose to implement security as best suits your needs. For one example of a bearer token approach, take a look at the [DCC Issuer Coordinator](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/issuer-coordinator).

#### Default Tenants

There are four tenants setup by default:

 * instance/test/credentials/issue
 * instance/testing/credentials/issue
 * instance/random/credentials/issue
 * instance/did-web-test/credentials/issue
 * instance/did-web-multikey-test/credentials/issue

The `test` and `testing` tenants both use this seed and corresponding [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/):

 * seed - `z1AeiPT496wWmo9BG2QYXeTusgFSZPNG3T9wNeTtjrQ3rCB`
 * did - `did:key:z6MknNQD1WHLGGraFi6zcbGevuAgkVfdyCdtZnQTGWVVvR5Q`

The `did-web-test` tenant also uses the same seed as `test` and `testing`, but with this did:

* did - `did:web:digitalcredentials.github.io:dcc-did-web`

The did document for the `did-web-test` tenant, which is a did:web did, is hosted here:

[https://digitalcredentials.github.io/dcc-did-web/did.json](https://digitalcredentials.github.io/dcc-did-web/did.json)

The did document for the `did-web-multikey-test` tenant, which is a did:web did whose verification method is of type 'multikey', is hosted here:

[https://digitalcredentials.github.io/dcc-did-web/multikey/did.json](https://digitalcredentials.github.io/dcc-did-web/multikey/did.json)

The [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) for the `test`, `testing` tenants, as well the did for the `did-web-test` tenant, are currently registered in the [DCC Sandbox Registry](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/sandbox-registry) so that any credentials generated with those tenants will, when verified, show as having originated from the DCC test issuer.

There is no effectively difference between the `test` and `testing` tenants - both are included simply for ease of use.

See the [Sign a credential](#sign-a-credential) section for a working CURL example of how to sign with the `test` tenant.

The `random` tenant generates a random signing key every time the server is started. This is strictly meant for testing and experimenting. For production use, you must generate your own signing keys.

Read on to generate your signing keys...

### Signing key

The issuer is by default configured with a signing key that can only be used for testing and evaluation.

To issue your own credentials you must generate your own signing key and keep it private.  We've tried to make that a little easier by providing two convenience endpoints in the issuer that you can use to generate a brand new key.  One generates a new [did:key](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/) and the other a new [did:web](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/). 

#### did:key generator

You can generate a new did:key by hitting the convenience endpoint with the following CURL command:

`curl --location 'http://localhost:4006/did-key-generator'`

This will return a json document with:

- a seed
- the corresponding [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)
- the corresponding [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) Document

The returned result will look something like this:

</details>

The two important properties for our purposes are the `seed` and the `did`.

Copy the `seed` value and add it as described in the [Tenant](#tenants) section above, basically like so:

`TENANT_SEED_{tenant name here}=seed`

For example,

`TENANT_SEED_CHEMISTRY101=z1AjQUBZCNoiyPUC8zbbF29gLdZtHRqT6yPdFGtqJa5VfQ6`

The signing-service uses the seed to deterministically generate the signing key.

The `did` value is meant to be shared with others, typically by publishing it in a public registry for use by verifiers.  Read about registries in the [registries section](#did-registries).

#### did:web generator

Setting up a did:web is a bit more complicated because - unlike a did:key - a did `document` has to be publicly available and must be hosted at a public url.

So you can generate a did:web document using our other convenience endpoint:

```POST /did-web-generator```

In this case you'll need to POST a json document to the endpoint. Here is a curl command that will do exactly that, assuming you are running the signing-service on localhost with the default port of 4006:

```
curl --location 'localhost:4006/did-web-generator' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"url": "https://digitalcredentials.github.io/dcc-did-web"}'
```

The value of 'url' property should be the url at which you will host your did:web document.
For the url above, the document will therefore need to be hosted at:

```https://digitalcredentials.github.io/dcc-did-web/did.json```

But, when generating the did, leave off the 'did.json' part. That bit is assumed, according to the did:web specification. 

Two caveats:

1. If you are hosting the did.json file at the root of your domain, so with no path, then you should put it into a folder (at the root of your domain) called `.well-known`. This is just what the did:web specification expects.

2. If you want to host your did document in a github repository (as we've done above), you'll need to publish your git repository as Github Pages, so that the file is properly returned with a json content-type header. The github raw url, by comparison, returns the file with a plain text content type, which some did-resolvers don't like.

So, that curl command to genrate a did:web will return a json document something like so:

        }
      ]
    }
}
```
</details>

Again, as with a did:key, you'll need to set the `seed` and register the `did`, as described in the prior [did:key generator](#didkey-generator) section.

You will additionally need to copy the value of the didDocument property, i.e, from the example above

```json
{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/x25519-2020/v1"
    ],
    "id": "did:web:digitalcredentials.github.io:dcc-did-web",
    "assertionMethod": [
        {
            "id": "did:web:digitalcredentials.github.io:dcc-did-web#z6MknNQD1WHLGGraFi6zcbGevuAgkVfdyCdtZnQTGWVVvR5Q",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:web:digitalcredentials.github.io:dcc-did-web",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "z6MknNQD1WHLGGraFi6zcbGevuAgkVfdyCdtZnQTGWVVvR5Q"
        }
    ]
}
```

and save that in a file called did.json at the url where you'll host the document. So for our example at:

```https://digitalcredentials.github.io/dcc-did-web/did.json```

You must also set the `TENANT_DIDMETHOD_{TENANT_NAME}=web` environment variable and set the `TENANT_DID_URL_{TENANT_NAME}` environement variable to the url where your `did.json` or `.well-known/did.json` did-document is hosted, which for this example would be:

```https://digitalcredentials.github.io/dcc-did-web```

IMPORTANT: THE EXAMPLE DIDS GENERATED ABOVE WON'T WORK AS-IS. YOU WILL NEED TO GENERATE YOUR OWN.

#### random tenant key

NOTE: there is also an option to set the seed value for a tenant to `generate`. The system will generate a random did:key for any tenants so configured. This is really only useful for testing and experimenting since the keys are lost on restart, and the associated [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) for each is not registered in any public registry.

### DID Registries

So that a verifier knows that a credential was signed by a key that is really owned by the claimed issuer, the key (encoded as a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)) has to be confirmed as really belonging to that issuer.  This is typically done by adding the DID to a well known registry that the verifier checks when verifying a credential.

The DCC provides a number of registries that work with the verifiers in the Learner Credential Wallet and in the online web based [Verifier Plus](https://verifierplus.org).  The DCC registries use Github for storage.  To request that your [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) be added to a registry, submit a pull request in which you've added your [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) to the registry file.

### did:key

The issuer is by default set up to use the did:key implemenation of a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) which is one of the simpler implementations and doesn't require that the [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) document be hosted anywhere.

### did:web

The did:web implementation is preferable for production becuase it allows you to rotate (change) your signing keys whithout having to update every document that points at the old keys.

To use it set `TENANT_DIDMETHOD_{TENANT_NAME}=web` and set `TENANT_DID_URL_{TENANT_NAME}` to the url where your `.well-known/did.json` did-document is hosted.

## Usage

This express app can be run a few different ways:

#### NPM

You can start the script using NPM, like is done with the `start` script in package.json

#### Directly from DockerHub

You can directly from the DockerHub image, using a default configuration, with:

  `docker run -dp 4006:4006 digitalcredentials/signing-service:1.1.0`

To run it with your own configuration (like with your own signing keys):

``docker run --env-file .env -dp 4006:4006 digitalcredentials/signing-service:1.1.0`

where the `.env` file contains your environment variables. See [.env.example](./.env.example).

#### With Docker Compose

See how we do that in the [DCC issuer-coordinator](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/issuer-coordinator)

Note that to run this with Docker, you'll of course need to install Docker, which is very easy with the [Docker installers for Windows, Mac, and Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Sign a credential

Try it out with this CURL command, which you simply paste into the terminal (once you've got your issuer running on your computer, as described above):

NOTE: CURL can get a bit clunky if you want to experiment - you might consider trying [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) which makes it a bit easier to construct and send http calls.

That curl should return a fully formed and signed credential printed to the terminal, that should look something like this (it may be all smushed up, but you can format it in something like [json lint](https://jsonlint.com):

You may have noticed the 'suite' query parameter on the url:

http://localhost:4006/instance/test/credentials/sign?<b>suite=eddsa2022</b>

You can specify either eddsa2022 or ed25519.  If you specify neither (you don't provide the query parameter) it defaults to ed25519.

Very cool is that you can specify both if you like:

http://localhost:4006/instance/test/credentials/sign?<b>suite=eddsa2022&suite=ed25519</b>

Which will add two proofs to your credential (two signatures), like so:

Including both signatures provides a measure of [Cryptographic Agility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_agility) - essentially allowing verifiers to choose which proof (or both!) to check.

The two signature types are both based on the same Edwards curve - the difference is only in how the details of the signature are encoded in the proof. The eddsa2022 suite is a newer and more modular encoding and likely what you want to use if you are just starting out.

You can read more about the suites here:

### Learner Credential Wallet

You might now consider importing your new credential into the [Learner Credential Wallet](https://lcw.app) to see how credentials can be managed and shared from an app based wallet.  Simply copy the verifiable credential you just generated and paste it into the text box on the 'add credential' screen of the wallet.

## Revocation

The signing-service doesn't on its own provide a revocation mechanism. To enable revocation, you'll want to combine the signing-service with a revocation system like the [DCC status-service](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/status-service), but we've already done exactly that with the [DCC issuer-coordinator](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/issuer-coordinator).

## Versioning

The signing-service is primarily intended to run as a docker image within a docker compose network, typically as part of a flow that is orchestrated by the [DCC Issuer Coordinator](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/issuer-coordinator) and the [DCC Workflow Coordinator](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/workflow-coordinator).

For convenience we've published the images for the signing-service and the other services used by the coordinators, as well as for the coordinators themselves, to Docker Hub so that you don't have to build them locally yourself from the github repositories.

The images on Docker Hub will of course at times be updated to add new functionality and fix bugs. Rather than overwrite the default (`latest`) version on Docker Hub for each update, we've adopted the [Semantic Versioning Guidelines](https://semver.org) with our docker image tags.

We DO NOT provide a `latest` tag so you must provide a tag name (i.e, the version number) for the images in your docker compose file.

To ensure you've got compatible versions of the services and the coordinator, take a look at our [sample compose files](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/docs/blob/main/deployment-guide/DCCDeploymentGuide.md#docker-compose-examples).

If you do ever want to work from the source code in the repository and build your own images, we've tagged the commits in Github that were used to build the corresponding Docker image. So a github tag of v1.1.0 coresponds to a docker image tag of 1.1.0

## Logging

We support the following log levels:

```
  error: 0,
  warn: 1,
  info: 2,
  http: 3,
  verbose: 4,
  debug: 5,
  silly: 6
```

Logging is configured with environment variables, as defined in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

By default, everything is logged to the console (log level `silly`).

All http calls to the service are logged by default, which might bloat the log. You can disable access logging with:

```ENABLE_ACCESS_LOGGING=false```

You may set the log level for the application as whole, e.g.,

```LOG_LEVEL=http```

Which would only log messages with severity 'http' and all below it (info, warn, error).

The default is to log everything (level 'silly').

You can also set the log level for console logging, e.g.,

```CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=debug```

This would log everything for severity 'debug' and lower (i.e., verbose, http, info, warn, error). This of course assumes that you've set the log level for the application as a whole to at least the same level.

The default log level for the console is 'silly', which logs everything.

There are also two log files that can be enabled:

* errors (only logs errors)
* all (logs everything - all log levels)

Enable each log by setting an env variable for each, indicating the path to the appropriate file, like this example:

```
LOG_ALL_FILE=logs/all.log
ERROR_LOG_FILE=logs/error.log
```
## Health Check

Docker has a [HEALTHCHECK](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#healthcheck) option for monitoring the
state (health) of a container. We've included an endpoint `GET healthz` that checks the health of the signing service (by running a test signature). The endpoint can be directly specified in a CURL or WGET call on the HEALTHCHECK, but we also provide a [healthcheck.js](./healthcheck.js) function that can be similarly invoked by the HEALTHCHECK and which itself hits the `healthz` endpoint, but additionally provides options for both email and Slack notifications when the service is unhealthy. 

You can see how we've configured the HEALTHCHECK in our [example compose files](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/docs/blob/main/deployment-guide/DCCDeploymentGuide.md#docker-compose-examples). Our compose files also include an example of how to use [autoheal](https://github.com/willfarrell/docker-autoheal) together with HEALTHCHECK to restart an unhealthy container.

If you want notifications sent to a Slack channel, you'll have to set up a Slack [web hook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

If you want notifications sent to an email address, you'll need an SMTP server to which you can send emails, so something like sendgrid, mailchimp, mailgun, or even your own email account if it allows direct SMTP sends. Gmail can apparently be configured to so so.

## Development

### Installation

Clone code then cd into directory and:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If for whatever reason you need to run the server over https, you can set the `ENABLE_HTTPS_FOR_DEV` environment variable to true.  Note, though, that this should ONLY be used for development.

### Testing

Testing uses supertest, jest, and nock to test the endpoints.  To run tests:

```npm run test```

Because the revocation (status) system uses github to store status, calls are made out to github during issuance.  Rather than have to make these calls for every test, and possibly in cases where outgoing http calls aren't ideal, we've used [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) to mock out the http calls to the github api, so that the actual calls needn't be made - nock instead returns our precanned replies.  Creating mocks can be time consuming, though, so we've also opted to use the recording feature of nock which allows us to run the tests in 'record' mode which will make the real calls out to Github, and record the results so they can be used for future calls.
